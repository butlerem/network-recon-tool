# Automated Network Reconnaissance Tool

## Overview

The **Automated Reconnaissance Tool** is a Python-based utility designed for streamlined reconnaissance during penetration testing or cybersecurity assessments. It automates common reconnaissance tasks, such as:

- **Port Scanning**: Identifies open ports and their services.
- **Subdomain Enumeration**: Finds subdomains via brute force or DNS lookups.
- **Banner Grabbing**: Retrieves service banners for version detection.

The tool is modular, extensible, and outputs results in machine-readable and human-readable formats.

## Features

- Automated scanning for open ports and services.
- Subdomain enumeration using brute force or DNS queries.
- Banner grabbing for detected services.
- Outputs results in structured formats like JSON.

## Project Structure

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/auto_recon_tool.git
   cd auto_recon_tool
Set up a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Roadmap
- Add API integrations for extended reconnaissance (e.g., Shodan, VirusTotal).
- Build a web-based dashboard for interactive results.
- Implement asynchronous scanning for improved performance.
